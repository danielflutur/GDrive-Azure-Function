## Steps to Accomplish the Automation Process in Azure DevOps Pipeline

### 1. Install Google Cloud SDK
Ensure that the agent running the Azure DevOps pipeline has the **Google Cloud SDK** installed (includes `gcloud` CLI).

### 2. Create the Service Account Command
This command creates a new service account named **my-service-account@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com**
```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create my-service-account \
  --description="Service account for downloading files from Google Drive" \
  --display-name="GDrive Download Viewer"
```

### 3. Assign the Viewer Role
After creating the service account, assign it the Viewer role so it can read (download) files from Google Drive. Replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID with the actual Google Cloud project ID. This command updates the IAM policy for your project to grant the Viewer role to the new service account.
```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  --member="serviceAccount:my-service-account@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/viewer"
```

### 4. Automate Key Generation
The following command is used to generate a key for the service account (to be used by the Azure function). This creates a JSON key file named key.json that you can securely upload to your secret store e.g., Azure Key Vault.
```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json \
  --iam-account=my-service-account@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```
